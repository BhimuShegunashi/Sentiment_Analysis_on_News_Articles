Libraries Import: This section imports essential libraries for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.</div>

Data Loading and Cleaning: The notebook loads data and performs data cleaning and preprocessing. The datasetâ€™s details (like columns or source) would need to be described in the README if known.</div>

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This part involves exploring the dataset through summary statistics, data visualizations, and initial insights.</div>

Modeling: The notebook likely includes model training, evaluation, and possibly some hyperparameter tuning.</div>

Results and Insights: The notebook presents results and insights from the analysis and models, though specific output isn't visible here.</div>

Here's a draft README based on this structure:</div>
